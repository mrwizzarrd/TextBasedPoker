Future Additions
    Class Action

        __Player action will hold__
        Player
        PlayerAction

    Class ActionLog
        a simple collection/array (linked list maybe???) of all actions whenever an action occurrs it will add to the collection
        this will allow for a bot player to view what players are doing what and decide what to do


    Add a confidence score to the BotPlayer
        instead of being agressive, it's confidence score (which will be based off the cards in play and the last actions) will also have a role in deciding it's action
